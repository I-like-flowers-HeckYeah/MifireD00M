Putting doom on an Mifare Classic 1k (kind of)

**THIS IS INCREDIBALLY BAD.**

**YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED**

Doom. a masterpiece, put onto a trillion things. The saying is, "if it preform logic, it can doom." (yeah I just made that one up) So, NFC (Near Field Communication) chips, or more specifically Mifare series NFC chips, have key based authentication, so that you can have only certain people be able to access sectors of data. And right there is your logic! *that's literally all of it...*

So, if you use a 'aim' value, set a 'target' value as the key to a sector, then the logic would be the player trying to change this 'aim' value (in sector 1, both blocks 1 and 2 work), and once these two values align, you get a hit! 

That is literally the entire game...

On the plus side, it only utilizes 3 sectors! I will be making a more complex version of doom with similar logic once I acquire a DESFire, which has an actuall CPU.
